## Downloads

Downloads can either be found on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chiseltones).

## Dependencies

This mod requires both [Chisel2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chisel) and [Ztones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ztones).

## Variation Modes

Currently, there are 2 modes to choose from when adding variations:

### Mode 0
Allow chiseling of the Ztones Tile into each of the different types Ztones adds at a meta of 0. Then you cycle through from there. This makes the crafting recipes useless.

---

### Mode 1
Allow chiseling between all the blocks within their type. This requires the user to still craft the type, but makes the cycling useless.
